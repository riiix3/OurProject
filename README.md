# OurProject#2


## Description 
This project provides an easier way to classify food for the user, and the process of classifying and dividing food is done in order to be able to identify the characteristics of each classification. Information on manufactured products and various food products.. and this is what we have adopted to apply in this project


## Introduction   
* The goal is to learn important software engineering skills and activities and establish an effective team work whilst making it easier for developers to get their wokr done.

* This project aims to develop a web-based machine learning system for a given text classification.
Text classification is a good way to classify text into categories, in addition using machine learning to automate these tasks makes the process much faster and more efficient.


## RUN program :
* To run this version of the system you need to do the following step :
1. Run index.js:
> node index.js


## How the user interacts with the system ?
* First step: the user will type a description of the food he wants to classify in the first text field .
* Second step: there will be a button at the bottom of the field responsible for sending the text and showing the result of the classification, just click on the "submite" button
, There is also another button, in case the user wants to modify his text, just click on the “Clear” button.


## 1.0.0 Version :
In this upgraded version we made some additional improvements over the initial version , that is why this version is considered somewhat "major Release" Because it has additional features :
* We have modified the user interface by adding a logo indicating what the system is .
* Also, a "CLEAR" button has been added, where if the user wants to modify his text, he can just click on it .
* We made the TextBox in the middle and made them an appropriate size to be easier for the user to see and use .
* In the initial version, the result of the labels was shown in console and in this version, the result will appear in the user interface .
